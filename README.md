# Cryptolime
This is a Python bot that simulates trading actual tickers.
Start and set up via run.py. The market simulation will then start and the bot will prepare.
Once the bot has finished trading, the results are saved to a new folder. The results include a plot and order history.
P.S. the algorithms are a bit dumb
